# Digit Detection with Deep Learning

This is a full example of how to detect hand-writting number with deep learning. The example is based on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a hand-written digit. The goal is to train a model to correctly classify the digit in the image.

## Run

```bash
python -m venv Env
./Env/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
